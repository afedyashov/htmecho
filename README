htmecho is a home for plain-text to browser utilities.

Currently, only one such utility lives here - wwwpy:

wwwpy is a plain text transformation tool (written in Python 3.2) that can be used as an 'echo' replacement. 
Whatever plain text input it receives will be transformed into HTML and sent to the default browser.
Page shown in the browser is enriched with incremental grep interface and simple coloring facility, which allows users to give different colors to result of different filters.

Some useful usage patterns:
- perform grep-like regexp filtering over the data you already have in the browser window
- apply colors to filters to improve analysis (e.g. gray for 'DEBUG' log lines, yellow for 'WARNING' and red for 'ERROR')
- on dual-monitor machines is is convenient to keep console on one screen and see the in the browser on the other screen. This way - you'll always see the command and the outcome at the same time. Just place console and browser as convenient and pipe your commands to wwwpy - results would appear as new tabs in your browser window

Initial purpose of this tool was to help those who have to deal with log files: developers, testers & support engineers.
